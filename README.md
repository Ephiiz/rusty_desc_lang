# rusty_desc_lang
Rusty Description Language is a Nand2Tetris HDL parser/interpreter written in Rust with any changes I decide to add during my time in the Nand2Tetris Course.

## Objectives
A parser and interpreter for RHDL (Rusty HDL) files, should be able to reference each other and use default implementations.
